## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for **CollegeDocs**, a web application designed for students to share and access PDF documents across different classes. The platform provides a simple, free, and minimalist environment for document exchange.

### 1.2 Scope

CollegeDocs allows students to:

* Create an account and log in securely.
* Upload PDFs with metadata (file name, subject).
* Search for PDFs by keywords or subject.
* View and download a list of available PDFs.

The application focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, targeting college students who need a lightweight document-sharing platform without unnecessary complexity.

✅ This keeps it **simple, student-friendly, and production-ready** while leaving room for scaling.

Would you like me to also make a **UI wireframe flow (login → upload → search → download)** for CollegeDocs so you have a visual reference?
